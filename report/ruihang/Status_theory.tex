\subsection{Status Theory}

Status theory is derived from \cite{}. The prediction made by this measure
is the difference between the status of vertex $u$ and vertex $v$. The status
$\sigma (i)$ of a vertex $i$ is defined as $\sigma (i) = |W^+_{in}(i)| - |W^-_{in}(i)| + |W^-_{out}(i)| - |W^+_{out}(i)|$.
Status increases when receiving positive incoming edges and generating negative 
outgoing edges to other vertices, while decreases when receiving negative edges 
and generating outgoing positive edges. Difference in status measures how much ‘higher’ $u’$s 
status is compared to $v’$s.
