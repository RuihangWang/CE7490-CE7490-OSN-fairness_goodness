\begin{abstract}
  A number of weighted signed networks (WSN) exist in our world while 
  many of them are incomplete. We are interested in finding the relationship
  and even capturing the scores between network users without direct connection.
  In this project, we first review a list of literatures that are
  related to signed social network. To predict weights of edges in 
  such networks, we gather a wide collection of existing edge weight
  prediction algorithms and test their performance on real-world datasets.
  Experiments of leaving one edge and leaving $N\%$ edeges are conducted,
  seperativly on each social network. The benchmarking results indicate
  that the combination of all the features of existing algorithms to learn
  a linear regression model outperforms the past techniques for edge weight
  prediction. To make it avaliable for interested researchers, we open-source our benchmark in

\section{Introduction}

With the rapid development of information technology, social 
network has become a significant part of modern life. As 
huge volumes of messages reflecting opinions and attitudes 
flowing on the network, social network analysis gradually gains 
popularity in a wide range of fields, including political 
science, social psychology and business analysis. Social 
network analysis offers a tool to seek for insight through 
the structure of social networks, but is limited by its 
complexity. Users are developing rich relationships through 
networks while analysis tools are generally reducing the 
relationships to simple links. To cover the gap between 
simplicity of network simulation and complexity of real 
relationships is an interesting research topic. 

In social network, people show different attitudes towards 
connection to others. The richness of a social network contains 
positive and negative interactions. The main part of connections 
are positive ones, including connecting with friends, fans, and
followers. There also exist negative connections, including 
scammers, political enemy and opponents. These connections can 
be used to predict relationships between independent users. 
For example, a politician might look at such people as potential 
voters for him if he has strength in that particular topic of 
interest. In the same vein, we might wish to estimate how much 
a person P1 agrees/disagrees with people who are already 
positive or negative about a product in order to quantify if 
they are more likely to be target customers of the product. 
Moreover, edge weight prediction may be useful to improve 
traditional tasks in signed networks such as node ranking
\cite{shahriari2014ranking}, anomaly detection\cite{Kmumar2014}
\cite{Wu:2016:TMR:2835776.2835816}, network 
analysis\cite{Kumar:2016:SDS:2872518.2889391}
\cite{leskovec2010signed}, community detection
\cite{PhysRevE.80.036115}, information diffusion
\cite{Shafaei_2014} \cite{Li2014} and sentiment 
prediction\cite{west2014}. Therefore, the prediction of edge 
weights in WSNs can be advantageous in various tasks, both 
when WSNs are explicit and implicit.

To better understand theories and master practical skills, we investigate and implement a common set of algorithms and evaluate their performance on real-world datasets. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{sec2} presents related work in this topic. Section \ref{sec3} describes the overview of our project. Section \ref{sec4} conducted experiments on real-world datasets using different algorithms. Section \ref{sec5} evaluates the performance of all tested methods. The conclusion is summarized in Section \ref{sec6}.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec2}
\subsection{Edge Sign Prediction in SSNs}
In the early stage, the work in
SSN mainly based on balance and status. The first of these 
theories is structural balance theory, which originated in 
social psychology in the mid-20th-century. As formulated by 
Heider in the 1940s\cite{heider1940}, and subsequently cast 
in graph-theoretic language by Cartwright and 
Harary\cite{Cartwright1956-CARSBA-4}, structural balance 
considers the possible ways in which triangles on three 
individuals can be signed, and posits that triangles with 
three positive signs and those with one positive sign are 
more plausible — and hence should be more prevalent in real 
networks — than triangles with two positive signs or none. 
Balanced triangles with three positive edges exemplify the 
principle that “the friend of my friend is my friend,” whereas 
those with one positive and two negative edges capture the 
notions that “the friend of my enemy is my enemy,” 
“the enemy of my friend is my enemy,” and 
“the enemy of my enemy is my friend.” 
Structural balance theory has been developed extensively 
in the time since this initial work\cite{wasserman1994social}, 
including the formulation of a variant “weak structural balance” 
proposed by Davis in the 1960s \cite{Davis1967}as a way of 
eliminating the assumption that “the enemy of my enemy is my 
friend”. Weak structural balance posits that only triangles 
with exactly two positive edges are implausible in real 
networks, and that all other kinds of triangles should be 
permissible.

Balance theory can be viewed as a model of likes and dislikes. 
However, as Guha et al. observe in the context of 
Epinions\cite{Guha:2004:PTD:988672.988727}, a signed link from 
P1 to P2 can have more than one possible interpretation, 
depending on P1’s intention in creating the link. 
In particular, a positive link from P1 may mean, 
“P2 is my friend,” but it also may mean, “I think P2 has higher 
status than I do.” Similarly, a negative link from P1 to P2 may
 mean “P2 is my enemy” or “I think P2 has lower status than 
 I do.”

Later work have developed features and models to predict the 
sign of an edge random-walk and trust-propagation 
algorithms\cite{Dubois}\cite{Guha:2004:PTD:988672.988727}, 
and using social interaction information for prediction
\cite{Yang2012}\cite{Tang:2016:SSN:2988524.2956185}. Metric 
Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) assigns an m-dimensional 
position to vertices in a SSN or WSN to minimize ‘stress’, 
based on extended balance theory\cite{Qian:2014:FTD:2639948.2628438}. 
It then uses the metric distance between two vertices to 
predict the sign of an edge between them. All of these papers 
predict edge sign in unweighted SSNs, while fairness and 
goodness method predicts the weight of an edge along with its 
sign. 

\subsection{Edge Weight Prediction in Social Networks}
There is substantial work on predicting edge weights in unsigned social 
networks. Communication based features have been shown to be 
very important in quantifying the edge weights between 
users\cite{Gilbert:2012:PTS:2145204.2145360}\cite{Gilbert:2009:PTS:1518701.1518736}
\cite{Xiang:2010:MRS:1772690.1772790}\cite{Kahanda2009}, but 
since we only have the WSN without any communication information, 
we compare with non-communication based techniques. These 
include baselines such as reciprocal edge weight\cite{Gilbert:2012:PTS:2145204.2145360} 
and triadic balance and status measures\cite{Gilbert:2009:PTS:1518701.1518736}
\cite{Sintos:2014:UST:2623330.2623664}. Two popular unsupervised 
algorithms are EigenTrust\cite{Kamvar:2003:EAR:775152.775242} 
and TidalTrust\cite{Katz2006}. EigenTrust calculates a global 
value of trust for each vertex by finding the left eigenvector 
of a normalized trust matrix. TidalTrust calculates the trust 
from a source to a sink, by recursively propagating trust via 
the sink’s predecessors till it reaches the source. A very 
recent work in this direction is trustingness and 
trustworthiness\cite{Roy2016}. However, these papers deal with 
edge weight prediction in unsigned social networks, while WSN 
is a new problem deriving from SSN. So in this paper, these 
techniques are implemented and compared with fairness and goodness 
method as benchmark models.

\section{Project Overview}
\label{sec3}
In this project, we extensively investigate and experiment methods for edge weight prediction in WSNs. All algorithms are tested and evaluated on published real-world datasets. Moreover, we try our best to improve the performance on some traditional methods. The finished works are summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Literature review on OSN and select a topic about predicting weight of edges for WSN.
	
	\item Investigated the state-of-the-art algorithms \emph{fairness-goodness} in\cite{kumar2016edge} and  studied a common set of baselines for weight prediction.
	
	\item Conducted experiments on each algorithm and reproduce the results mentioned in original paper using real-world dataset.
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Experimental 1 -   Removing one edge prediction}: 
    When we remove one of the edges from the network and try to 
    predict it from the rest of network structure one at a time, 
    we compared fairness and goodness metrics with other typical 
    methods and noticed that fairness and goodness method produces 
    almost the best result. 
	
    \item \emph{Experimental 2 -  Removing $N \%$-out edge prediction}: 
    When we remove $N\%$ of the edges from the network and try to 
    predict them from each of the individual features, we see 
    that in all cases, fairness and goodness metrics are the best.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item  Evaluated results of different methods and summarized the conclusions of this project.
	
\end{enumerate}
