% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\section{Introduction}

[Context] A number of weighted signed networks (WSN) exist in our world while many of them are incomplete. The values for weights prediction are ...

[Existing Solutions] State-of-the-art fairness and goodness. Baselines: Reciprocal, Triadic balance, Triadic Status, Pagerank ....

[Our project]  To better understand theories and master practical skills, we investigate and implement a common set of algorithms and evaluate their performance on real-world datasets. 

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents related work in this topic. Section 3 describes the overview of our project. Section 4 formulates the problem of weight prediction in weighted signed networks. Section 5 conducted experiments on real-world datasets using different algorithms. Section 6 evaluates the performance of all tested methods. The conclusion is summarized in Section 7.

\section{Project Overview}

In this project, we extensively investigate and experiment methods for edge weight prediction in weighted signed networks. All algorithms are tested and evaluated on published real-world datasets. Moreover, we try our best to improve the performance on some traditional methods. The finished works are summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Literature review on OSN and select a topic about predicting weight of edges for weighted signed network.
	
	\item Investigate the state-of-the-art algorithms \emph{fairness-goodness} in [ ] and  studied a common set of baselines for weight prediction.
	
	\item Conducted experiments on each algorithm and reproduce the results mentioned in original paper using real-world dataset.
	
	\emph{Experimental 1 -   Removing one edge prediction} : ...
	
	\emph{Experimental 2 -  Removing N \%-out edge prediction} : ...
	
	\item Evaluate results of different methods.
\end{enumerate}
