We implemented two series of experiments to evaluate the 
performance of fairness and goodness method on three public 
WSN datasets mentioned above. 

\textbf{Experiment1:} leave-one-out prediction
In these experiments, one weighted edge is removed at a time 
and nine algorithms are implemented to predict the weight of 
test edge, simulating the situation where we want to calculate 
the weight of a non-existed edge. The root-mean-square error 
(RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) are calculated 
in each loot and the average result is shown in table \ref{table1}. 
Fairness and goodness method achieved almost the best 
performance among all datasets and showed robustness. 
The linear regression result trained by all other features 
is the best one. 

\textbf{Experiment2:}: leave-N\%-out prediction
In this part, we removed a larger number of edges to further 
evaluate the performance of F\&G algorithm. We randomly selected 
N\% of the edges, remove them as test edges and predict their 
weight from the rest of the network. The value of N range from 10 
to 90 with a step of 10. Figure\ref{figure3}, Figure\ref{figure4} and 
Figure\ref{figure5} showed average RMSE and PCC results in 
the three datasets. F\&G method beats most of the algorithms 
and the linear regression method showed robustness and performed 
nearly the best in all datasets. We noticed that the performance of
 the linear regression method showed stability when the percentage 
 of removed edges varies, meaning that this method can handle 
 networks partly invisible, especially online networks 
 constrained by privacy items.
