\subsection{Reciprocal}
As a baseline of weight prediction, the reciprocal algorithm takes the 
weight of ($v,u$) is equal to the weight of ($u,v$). When the reciprocal edge 
doesn't exist, the weight of that edge is set to 0. Therefore, the weight of ($u,v$)
is predicted by:

\begin{equation}
W(u,v) =
\begin{cases}
W(v,u),& \text{if $u \rightarrow v$ exist} \\
0,&  \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
